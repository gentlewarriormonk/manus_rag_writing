Summary: A sample substack about analysis.



Looking ahead, I'll be attending the Technology Ethics Symposium in Copenhagen next month and would love to connect with any subscribers who will be there. These conversations are always richer in person, and I'm particularly interested in hearing your perspectives on the topics we've been exploring in this newsletter.

In this week's newsletter, we're examining the recent developments in decentralized finance that have largely flown under the mainstream radar. While headlines focus on cryptocurrency price fluctuations, the more significant innovation is happening in governance structures that could fundamentally reshape how financial systems operate.

The most compelling book I've encountered this month is Professor Alicia Wong's 'Networks of Meaning,' which offers a fresh theoretical framework for understanding how information spreads through social systems. Her integration of complexity science with traditional media theory provides valuable tools for analyzing our current information ecosystem.
